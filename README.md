# Weakness Lab
***This project is a Flask-based Vulnerable Lab, designed to provide users with an interactive platform to understand and exploit real-world security vulnerabilities. Participants can explore, exploit, and enhance their skills in secure coding by identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities present in the lab environment.***

### Includes

* SQL Injection (SQLi): Demonstrates SQL injection vulnerabilities that arise when user inputs are not properly sanitized.
  
* Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI): Exploits server-side template injection vulnerabilities using Jinja2 or other template engines.

* Information Disclosure: Exposes information disclosure vulnerabilities that occur due to improper application configurations or careless error message handling.

* Command Injection: Illustrates command injection vulnerabilities that arise when user inputs are not properly validated.

* Brute Force Attack: Allows users to perform brute force attacks by attempting different username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access.
